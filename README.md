# Clarity Bootcamp Coding Examples

### Goal: 
This repo will contain all the different Clarity code examples completed in the ATX Stacks Fall 2022 bootcamp. Here we will look into the syntax of Clarity, build out some basic apps to manipulate chain state and interact with principals and then finally write tests in TypeScript to ensure our code works as expected.
